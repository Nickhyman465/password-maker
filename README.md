# password-maker
This password-generator project was aimed at using confirmations from the user to determine what kind of password they would like to generate.
This projects aim was to get a password that was between 8-128 characters long and contained numbers, letters, or special characters.

# Process
I started buy writing variables that would need to later hold a boolean input.
Next, I needed to code the generatePassword function so that we can pass the custom password into the password variable.
My logic the generatePassword function required multiple arrays for the varying character combinations.
Next, I displayed the windows that asked for the password criteria and then the conditional statements followed.
The conditional statements checked for the different password criteria combinations first.
Within each if statement, I used a loop that makes a password based on the user's criteria and passes back that password value
lastly, I ran a conditional statement for whether or not the user wanted upper case letters.
